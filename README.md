B-Keeper
========

The files required to set up B-Keeper for Ableton Live, includes externals, max for live patches and a quick dec file.

Requirements: Mac OS X


1. Move the externals to the Max search path. For .mxo files (Mac OS X) only to Max6->Cycling74->max-externals

2. Move Java externals (ending .class) to Max6->Cycling74->Java->classes. These could work with windows if required? (email for details)

3. Download example test recordings from www.b-keeper.org/links page

4. open audio project. click "expert". Check response etc not all zero. click "recorded files". Open the test kick and snare. press "play". This should start Live and have tempo changing to match the recordings.
