quick note

Externals

place .mxo ones and the whole bonk~ folder in:
Applications->Max6->cycling'74->max-externals

(assumes Mac OS X)


For Windows, use Java version so
put the Java .class ones in
Applications->Max6->cycling'74->Java->Classes

then the project, B-KeeperAudio2_Java will work (loads up BKeeper15_Java.amxd)

There are two projects:
an Audio one - for Mac only - and a MIDI one 


1.
try the BKeeperAudio project

it should let you click

"expert"

check the response is roughly halfway or more, not zero (max sometimes doesn't load decent settings)

then click "use recorded files"

->small window pops up

open Kick and Snare downloaded from B-Keeper.org (see links?)

These are close mic'ed signals, good for testing

press play

now try and launch Live - eg TAP in time to start.

you can have B-Keeper trigger using the "contain" on the front page - i.e. listen for clicked sticks on snare mic. This was useful Live. When it's zero, it lets you start the Live set.

does the tempo respond? does it stay in time with the drums?

2. the MIDI project
this can use Java or C external

it's slightly hard-coded for a Roland MIDI kit.

works in a similar was as above. You probably want to test that the drum kit will light up kick and snare in orange,
