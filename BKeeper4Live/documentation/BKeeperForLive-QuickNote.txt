IMPORTANT - B-Keeper won't work unless the externals are found by Max. The externals are the code that runs B-Keeper, so externals are "code objects" in MaxMSP. Max then provides a way of interfacing with Ableton - getting audio and messages that the code requires. The output from the B-Keeper external changes Live's using Max4Live.

Externals

place .mxo ones and the whole bonk~ folder in:
Applications->Max6->cycling'74->max-externals

(assumes Mac OS X)


put the Java .class ones in
Applications->Max6->cycling'74->Java->Classes

There are two projects:
an Audio one - for Mac only - and a MIDI one 


1.
try the BKeeperAudio project

it should let you click

"expert"

check the response is roughly halfway or more, not zero (max sometimes doesn't load decent settings)

then click "use recorded files"

->small window pops up

open Kick and Snare downloaded from B-Keeper.org - test files are the "example files" here:
http://www.b-keeper.org/links.html

These are close mic'ed signals, good for testing this before getting drums involved.

press play - you should hear the audio coming through the BKeeperAudio channel in Live.

now try and launch Live - eg TAP in time to start.

you can have B-Keeper trigger using the "contain" on the front page - i.e. listen for clicked sticks on snare mic. This was useful Live. When it's zero, it lets you start the Live set.

does the tempo respond? does it stay in time with the drums?

2. the MIDI project
this can use Java or C external

it's slightly hard-coded for a Roland MIDI kit. There's a screenshot here that shows how - these MIDI numbers trigger a "kick" and "snare" signal.

works in a similar was as above. You probably want to test that the drum kit will light up kick and snare in orange, 

you can choose to respond to cymbal events with toggle box, not sure which best, maybe off for now.

try playing the Live project and using drums.
